# Hello world

I am getting to grips with how Github works, and created this learning repository and readme markdown file to help me learn.  
I first updated this document via pull request to understand how branches worked.

README files are markdown guides that developers write to describe their project. They are often hosted as a website. They should include things like:
* Project name - primary goal & aim
* Description of project
* How to use your project - instructions, examples
* Team credits

.md files are created using markdown language software, which is a lightweight markup language used to format text on the web with plain text formatting syntax.
