# Hello world

On 21/07/2022 I created this learning repository to:
* become more familiar with Github
* keep record of basic SQL syntax
* keep record of basic Python syntax
* prepare to do an analytics project using SQL and Python

**Progress update 28/07/2022**

I'm working through introductory SQL and Python courses on Datacamp, and have covered:
* Selecting columns with SQL
* Filtering rows with SQL
* Python basics
* Python lists

Next week I want to have covered aggregate functions, sorting, and grouping with SQL, and introduction to functions, packages, and Numpy in Python.
